### Description

This was a piece of software i did for my HSC major assesment, 93% cheerin! Anyway, i have put a fair bit of work into it, it still has bugs, coz i only finished it the other day i haven't had a chance to fully de-bug it. There are also some changes I would like to make in the near future, but it is basically finish, so please enjoy, let me know what u think, and PLEASE vote high, i would love to win this months comp :-)
